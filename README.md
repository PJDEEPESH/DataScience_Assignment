# eCommerce Data Science Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains my solution to the eCommerce Data Science Assignment. The dataset consists of three files: `Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, and `Transactions.csv`. The assignment involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a Lookalike Model, and performing Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Repository Structure

- **EDA:**
  - `Deepesh_PodipparaJacob_EDA.pdf`: PDF report containing business insights derived from EDA.
  - `Deepesh_PodipparaJacob_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for performing EDA.

- **Lookalike Model:**
  - `Deepesh_PodipparaJacob_Lookalike.csv`: A CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes and their similarity scores for the first 20 customers.
  - `Deepesh_PodipparaJacob_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook explaining and implementing the Lookalike Model.

- **Customer Segmentation / Clustering:**
  - `Deepesh_PodipparaJacob_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report containing the clustering results, DB Index value, and business insights.
  - `Deepesh_PodipparaJacob_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- Performed an in-depth EDA to understand customer behavior, transactions, and product trends.
- Derived at least 5 actionable business insights, such as:
  - Identifying high-value customer segments.
  - Analyzing purchasing patterns across different regions and products.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- Developed a Lookalike Model that recommends the top 3 customers similar to a given user based on both customer profile and transaction history.
- Generated a CSV file with customer ID mappings and similarity scores for the first 20 customers in the dataset.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- Used clustering techniques to segment customers based on both profile and transaction data.
- Chose an appropriate clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means).
- Evaluated clustering quality using the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index).
- Visualized the clusters using 2D plots to interpret customer segments.
